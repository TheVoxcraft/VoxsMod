I have always been annoyed that the vanilla DPS meter does not work well for slow weapons, or to measure your maximum average DPS during a fight, so:

Introducing the Advanced DPS Meter, the ultimate upgrade to your Terraria combat analytics! Crafted with precision from the searing Hellstone bars and the classic vanilla DPS Meter, this item takes combat data to a new level.

Key Features:

- Exponential Moving Average: Utilizing EWA calculations, the Advanced DPS Meter provides a smooth and responsive readout over a longer time than the vanilla DPS meter.
- Fast-Open: Quickly recalibrates the damage per second calculation after you've taken a short break from combat, giving fast but accurate DPS readings.
- Customization: Modify the DPS tracking window, smoothing and the Fast-Open reactivation timeout to your liking.


Craft with a DPS Meter and a Hellstone bar.
